# EHMM: an Efficient Hidden Markov Model for Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition

This is the source code of the final project for NLP course.

## Data

You can get the data ```Few-NERD``` (**https://github.com/thunlp/Few-NERD?tab=readme-ov-file#few-nerd-dataset**).

## Code

There is a ```model.py``` of HMM and a ```model2.py``` of ours EHMM. You can just run them by python tool, like ```python ./model2.py```

And there is a ```key_words.py``` used to obtain key words.

```Process_data.py``` is used to process the data, split the raw data into words and labels.

```test.py``` is used to test our model's output against the correct results.
